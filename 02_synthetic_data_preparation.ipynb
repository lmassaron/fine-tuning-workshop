        "\n",
        "1.  **`ingest`**: This first step takes your raw data from various sources and converts it into a standardized text format. It can handle a wide range of file types, including:\n",
        "    *   PDFs (`.pdf`)\n",
        "    *   Word Documents (`.docx`)\n",

It takes the ingested text, intelligently splits it into manageable chunks, and then uses a powerful LLM (like Llama 3) to generate new, synthetic data based on that text. You can instruct it to create different types of datasets, such as:\n",
        "    *   **Question-Answer (QA) pairs**: Ideal for building chatbots and Q&A systems.\n",
        "    *   **Reasoning Traces / Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Creates examples that show the step-by-step reasoning process, which is useful for improving a model's logical abilities.\n",
        "    *   **Summaries**: Generates summaries of the text chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`curate`**: To ensure high quality, this command uses an LLM as a \"judge\" to review the synthetically generated examples. It filters out low-quality or irrelevant pairs, ensuring that the final dataset is clean and effective for fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **`save-as`**: The final step is to export the curated data into a format that is compatible with popular fine-tuning libraries and workflows. You can save the dataset as:\n",
        "    *   Hugging Face Datasets\n",
        "    *   JSON or JSONL files\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the `synthetic-data-kit` provides an end-to-end, customizable pipeline for turning your private documents or domain-specific knowledge into a structured dataset that can be used to make a powerful, general LLM an expert in your specific area of interest."

        "    *   Fine-tune much larger models on consumer-grade GPUs (like an RTX 3090 or a free Google Colab T4).\n",
        "    *   Use a much larger batch size, which can further speed up training and improve model performance.\n",
        "*   **No Performance Loss:** These optimizations are achieved without sacrificing the final model's accuracy or performance.\n",
        "*   **Easy to Use:** It's designed as a \"drop-in\" replacement. You typically only need to change a few lines of your existing Hugging Face training script to enable it. For example, you replace `AutoModelForCausalLM` with Unsloth's `FastLanguageModel`."

However, Gauss\\'s method was understood immediately and is still used today. Two decades before Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s writing, the Canadian-American dynamic astronomer Simon Newcomb had published a series of books analyzing motions of planets in the Solar System. The notoriously spiteful Newcomb could have been an inspiration for Professor Moriarty. In 1887, Henri Poincaré\\'s submission to the celestial mechanics contest of King Oscar II of Sweden investigated the three-body problem, a theoretical basis of asteroid dynamics. It was also hard to criticize, as the jury (Weirstrass, Mittag-Leffler, and Hermite, all top-notch mathematicians) and the author himself missed a fatal error in the submission (later corrected). Another example of mathematics too abstruse to be criticized is the letters of Srinivasa Ramanujan, sent to several mathematicians at the University of Cambridge in 1913. Only one of these mathematicians, G. H. Hardy, even recognized their merit. Despite being experts in the branches of mathematics used, he and J. E. Littlewood added that many of them \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before.\" It has taken over a century for this work to be understood; the last sub-field (and the last problem of the last sub-field) have been referred to as The Final Problem in explicit reference to the Sherlock Holmes story. Holmes only states that \"it is said\" (emphasis added) that no one in the scientific press was capable of criticizing Moriarty\\'s work; he stops short of recognizing the claim as indisputably accurate. Similarly, when it was jocularly suggested to Arthur Eddington in 1919 that he was one of only three people in the world who understood Albert Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, Eddington quipped that he could not think who the third person was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.1, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.\n",

The notoriously spiteful Newcomb could have been an inspiration for Professor Moriarty. In 1887, Henri Poincaré\\'s submission to the celestial mechanics contest of King Oscar II of Sweden investigated the three-body problem, a theoretical basis of asteroid dynamics. It was also hard to criticize, as the jury (Weirstrass, Mittag-Leffler, and Hermite, all top-notch mathematicians) and the author himself missed a fatal error in the submission (later corrected). Another example of mathematics too abstruse to be criticized is the letters of Srinivasa Ramanujan, sent to several mathematicians at the University of Cambridge in 1913. Only one of these mathematicians, G. H. Hardy, even recognized their merit. Despite being experts in the branches of mathematics used, he and J. E. Littlewood added that many of them \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before.\" It has taken over a century for this work to be understood; the last sub-field (and the last problem of the last sub-field) have been referred to as The Final Problem in explicit reference to the Sherlock Holmes story. Holmes only states that \"it is said\" (emphasis added) that no one in the scientific press was capable of criticizing Moriarty\\'s work; he stops short of recognizing the claim as indisputably accurate. Similarly, when it was jocularly suggested to Arthur Eddington in 1919 that he was one of only three people in the world who understood Albert Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, Eddington quipped that he could not think who the third person was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=512, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.\n",
